## Behavior and rules of the simulation

## Simulation text files format

## User manual (Linux)

First install the following libraries:

- GLUT: use `sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev`
- GLUI: download `libglui2c2` and `libglui` (check [here](http://www.rpmseek.com/index.html?hl=com)), then use `dpkg -i <package name>`.

Then you should be able to compile in source folder using `make`. Many test files are available in the test_files folder. Most of them are meant to trigger a specific error scenario. To get a a working simulation try `F04.txt` or build your own simulation text file! 

The programme has 4 working modes:

- Error (for grading purposes only)
- Verification (for grading purposes only)
- Graphic (for grading purposes only)
- Final ‚úîÔ∏è

`./bugslife.x [Error|Verification|Graphic|Final, F04.txt]`

The default mode is Final.

Through the UI you can open a simulation text file, save the current state of the simulation, start/stop the simulation, record the simulation (plots with gnuplots), and control food generation.
